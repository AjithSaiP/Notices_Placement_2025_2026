<b>Type</b>    : INTERNSHIP<br>
<b>Subject</b> : CV Submission deadline/CGPA Cut-Off<br>
<b>Company</b> : Sqwish<br>
<br>Job Description: 1. What we do.
<br>
<br>We build software that helps AI apps learn as they run. Each call learns from feedback. We choose the model, prompt, context and memory that work best so replies are more accurate, faster, and more useful.
<br>
<br>
<br>2. Who we are.
<br>
<br>I’m Ushnish, IIT Kharagpur ’15. I did a PhD in AI at Cambridge, then spent time in industry and saw the gap between pretty benchmarks and what users actually need. My co-founder Federica Freddi and I left the lab to fix that. We started Sqwish in Cambridge with support from the university and strong angels. We are small, hands-on, and ship fast. You will work directly with us and see your work reach real users.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>3. What you’ll work on
<br>Pick a primary lane and collaborate across the rest.
<br>
<br>Research: simple learning policies, reward design, practical evaluation.
<br>
<br>ML/MLOps: low-latency services, routing, containers, profiling, observability.
<br>
<br>Data: clean feedback pipelines, clear schemas, batch and streaming jobs.
<br>
<br>Backend: APIs for routing and memory, caching, rate limits, safe rollouts and rollbacks.
<br>
<br>Our stack
<br>Python, FastAPI, Postgres, Redis, Docker, basic K8s, Grafana and Prometheus, Weights &amp; Biases, open models like Llama and Qwen, and TypeScript/React for internal tools. Rust or Go is a bonus, not required.
<br>
<br>4. What we value
<br>
<br>Clear code that runs fast and fails safe.
<br>
<br>Evidence over hype. Plots and tests beat opinions.
<br>
<br>Builders who remove flakiness without drama.
<br>
<br>Plain writing that others can follow.
<br>
<br>5. Logistics
<br>
<br>We're remote-friendly but we are building a base in Bangalore!
<br>
<br>Stipend: 2000 USD per month (Bangalore-based) gross salary
<br>
<br>Duration: 3 months, flexible. Strong interns get return offers.
<br>
<br>We provide mentorship, GPU time, and real data with privacy guardrails.

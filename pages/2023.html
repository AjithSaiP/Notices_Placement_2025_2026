<b>Type</b>    : PLACEMENT<br>
<b>Subject</b> : Urgent<br>
<b>Company</b> : CDC Placement process 2025-26<br>
<br>Presently CDC is opening all the depts, specializations (in most cases) against any opportunity being offered by the company.
<br>
<br>As placement interviews, tests are being conducted / will be conducted simultaneously, reviewing of each job notification is not possible.
<br>
<br>Hence CDC is offering the whole bouquet of interested students before the company to choose the relevant dept/ specialization etc.as decided by them.
<br>
<br>Note that CDC has no role in the shortlisting process of any company.
<br>
<br>Chairman&nbsp;CDC<br>

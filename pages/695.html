<b>Type</b>    : INTERNSHIP<br>
<b>Subject</b> : CV Submission deadline/CGPA Cut-Off<br>
<b>Company</b> : Vellex Computing<br>
<br>Job Description: About the Role :
<br>We are developing an advanced software stack that enables the integration of mathematical modeling, circuit simulation, and embedded logic for edge computing applications in energy, control, and automation. As an intern, you will contribute to building the software tools and infrastructure that drive simulation pipelines, embedded control workflows, and hardware interfacing. The work involves circuit modeling, object-oriented programming, data-driven workflows, and software abstractions that support digital and analog system behavior. You’ll help prototype and validate software systems that interact with physical electronics and real-time computing platforms.
<br>
<br>What You’ll Do :
<br>● Work with electronic components such as transistors, Op-Amps, FETs, and
<br>passive/active circuit elements
<br>● Simulate and model circuit behavior using tools like LTspice, NGSpice, or equivalent 
<br>● Develop software tools to automate circuit generation, simulation workflows, and result parsing 
<br>● Implement firmware or system code on microcontrollers (e.g., STM32, ESP32) and edge devices (e.g., Jetson, Raspberry Pi) 
<br>● Prototype embedded logic or control blocks using FPGAs or FPAAs 
<br>● Use object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to build maintainable and reusable simulation and control frameworks 
<br>● Benchmark system performance across metrics like latency, stability, power
<br>consumption, and accuracy
<br>
<br>Required Skills :
<br>● Strong understanding of circuit fundamentals, including behavior of transistors (BJT,
<br>MOSFET) and operational amplifiers (op-amps) 
<br>● Experience using circuit simulation software (LTspice, NGSpice, or similar) 
<br>● Proficiency in Python (including libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, pandas) 
<br>● Working knowledge of C/C++ for embedded or systems programming 
<br>● Understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) and modular software design
<br>
<br>Nice to Have :
<br>● Hands-on experience with HDL (Verilog/VHDL) or FPGA-based prototyping 
<br>● Previous work in hardware-software co-simulation or hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setups 
<br>● Interest in analog-digital hybrid systems, reconfigurable computing, or unconventional computing models
<br>
<br>What You’ll Gain :
<br>● Deep understanding of physical computing and hardware-accelerated system design 
<br>● Hands-on experience with integrated analog, digital, and software-based computation 
<br>● Exposure to real-world applications in energy, optimization, and embedded intelligence 
<br>● Close mentorship and the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to a research-grade product <br><br><br>Find the below details about CV Submission deadline/CGPA Cut-Off:<br><br>CV Submission Starting From (yyyy-mm-dd): 2025-09-02<br>CV Submission Ending At (yyyy-mm-dd): 2025-09-03<br>CGPA Cut Off: 6.5<br><br>Interested students are advised to apply at the ERP portal within the given deadline.<br>No further extensions will be provided.<br><br><br><br>Chairman, CDC<br>
